# Gator-aid

Our product aims to benefit the UF community, primarily students. Those aid students who struggle in rigorous classes where resources are not widely available. 
For example, Study Edge and Smokin Notes aim to help students who struggle in big STEM classes however there are numerous classes where students still struggle and there are no extra services available. Our platform aims to build a community where students can provide extra resources to reach success.
